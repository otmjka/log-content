result code can be found in the [project repository](https://github.com/otmjka/aws-node-app)

the goals are:

1. set up a deploy the app to the aws ecs via pushing to `production` branch
2. easy to create resources for an app in aws ecr.

## set up a deploy the app to the aws ecs via pushing to `production` branch



[github doc: Deploying to Amazon Elastic Container Service](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/use-cases-and-examples/deploying/deploying-to-amazon-elastic-container-service)

it follows from [deploy workflow ./github/workflows/deploy.yaml](https://github.com/otmjka/aws-node-app/blob/main/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml)
that we need

```
${{ vars.AWS_REGION }} # AWS region, e.g. us-west-1
${{ vars.ECR_REPOSITORY }} # Amazon ECR repository name
${{ vars.ECS_SERVICE }} # Amazon ECS service name
${{ vars.ECS_CLUSTER }} # Amazon ECS cluster name

# set this to the name of the container in the
# containerDefinitions section of your task definition
${{ vars.CONTAINER_NAME }} 

# set this to the path to your Amazon ECS task definition
# file, e.g. .aws/task-definition.json
ECS_TASK_DEFINITION 


```

and the variables gonna populate in `easy to create resources for an app in aws ecr.` section via `terraform`.

and we populate `ECS_TASK_DEFINITION`  by `./aws-ecs-task-defenition.json`
and `./aws-ecs-task-defenition.json` from aws-created json task-defenition 

after all we should pul all variables at your repository action variables(settings -> variables and secrets -> actions)

moreover we will need aws user credentials
```
${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
```

this will be brifly descibe in follow step `signup in aws`
## easy to create resources for an app in aws ecr.

### signup in aws

go to aws and explore a stuff about `free tier`.
register on aws for `free tier`, there is required payment info.
after this step, we can create an user.

%here source where can check for aws registration, user creation%

after this we have

```
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
AWS_REGION: eu-north-1
```

### terraform 

[install terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli)

go to aws and explore a stuff about `free tier`.

register on aws for `free tier`, there is required payment info.

after this step, we can create an user.

%here source where can check for aws registration, user creation%

after this we have

```
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
AWS_REGION: eu-north-1
```

now we need to create 

repository for the project, this can be done by aws ui:
[AWS ECR](https://eu-north-1.console.aws.amazon.com/ecr/get-started?region=eu-north-1) `->` [repositories](https://eu-north-1.console.aws.amazon.com/ecr/private-registry/repositories?region=eu-north-1) `->` Create repository

```
ECR_REPOSITORY: akjmto/aws-node-app
```

### terraform 

[install terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli)

there are some init steps:

```terraform
# terraform/provider.tf

terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "~> 5.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "aws" {
  region = var.aws_region
}


# terraform/variables.tf

variable "aws_region" {
  description = "AWS region to deploy to"
  type        = string
  default     = "eu-north-1"
}

variable "app_name" {
  description = "Application name"
  type        = string
  default     = "aws-node-app"
}


variable "container_image" {
  description = "Container image URI"
  type        = string
  default     = "762233768038.dkr.ecr.eu-north-1.amazonaws.com/akjmto/aws-node-app"
}

variable "container_port" {
  description = "Port exposed by the container"
  type        = number
  default     = 80
}


# terraform/terraform.tfvars
# copy defaults of terraform/variables.tf

aws_region = "eu-north-1"
app_name = "aws-node-app"
container_port = 80
container_image = "762233768038.dkr.ecr.eu-north-1.amazonaws.com/akjmto/aws-node-app"

```

`container_image` - after repository creation

```terraform

# File: ecr.tf

resource "aws_ecr_repository" "akjmto_aws_node_app" {
  name                 = "akjmto/aws-node-app"
  image_tag_mutability = "MUTABLE"

  image_scanning_configuration {
    scan_on_push = true
  }
}

```

```bash
terraform plan
terraform init

```
go to aws ecr repositories
[my repositories](https://eu-north-1.console.aws.amazon.com/ecr/private-registry/repositories?region=eu-north-1)

and copy `repository name`, `URI`

```yaml
.github/workflows/deploy.yaml
ECR_REPOSITORY: akjmto/aws-node-app

# terraform
container_image: 762233768038.dkr.ecr.eu-north-1.amazonaws.com/akjmto/aws-node-app
```

oks. remain

```

ECS_TASK_DEFINITION
```

### Task Definition [ECS_TASK_DEFINITION]

`!!!TODO: short defenition, somehow to hide with ref to micro article`
```

**Task Definition in AWS ECS**

• **Description**: A Task Definition is a template for running tasks in AWS ECS (Elastic Container Service). It specifies which Docker containers to run and how to configure them.

• **Main Features**:

• **Container Definition**: It specifies which Docker images to launch, their network settings, CPU and memory limits, environment variables, and other parameters.

• **Network Settings**: The Task Definition can define networking (for instance, associating with a VPC and subnets) and security policies.

• **Dependency Management**: It allows you to define the order in which containers should start and the rules for restarting them in case of failure.

• **Usage**: Task Definitions are used to describe the configuration of one or more containers that are to run in ECS. For example, a Task Definition might include both a web server container and a database container, which together make up a single application.

**How AWS ECR and Task Definitions Work Together**

When a Docker image is uploaded to AWS ECR, it can be referenced in a Task Definition so ECS (or another container orchestrator) knows which image to run and which parameters to apply. The Task Definition includes a link to the specific Docker image in ECR (such as by URL), and when the task is started, ECS automatically pulls the image from ECR and deploys the container.
```

in our case ECS_TASK_DEFINITION is a path to a json file. 

content for this you can create by your self, go to 

[AWS ECS -> Task Definitions](https://eu-north-1.console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/v2/task-definitions?region=eu-north-1)`->` Create new task defenition 

```
Task definition family: aws-node-app-task-family
cpu 0.5 mem 1 GB

Container 1

name: aws-node-app
uri: 762233768038.dkr.ecr.eu-north-1.amazonaws.com/akjmto/aws-node-app:latest

Environment variables:

PORT 80

-> CREATE !
```

after go to 
```
1. [Amazon Elastic Container Service]
2. [Task definitions]
3. [aws-node-app-task-family]
4. [Revision 1]
5. Containers
6. JSON
7. copy to clipboard
8. paste ./aws-ecs-task-defenition.json
9. remove useless taskDefinitionArn, revision, compatibilities, registeredAt, registeredBy
```


`./aws-ecs-task-defenition.json`

```json
{
"family": "aws-node-app-task-family",
"containerDefinitions": [{
	"name": "aws-node-app",
	"image": "...",
	"portMappings": [{
		"name": "aws-node-app-80-tcp",
		"containerPort": 80,
		"hostPort": 80,
		"protocol": "tcp",
		"appProtocol": "http"
	}],
	"essential": true,
	"environment": [{
		"name": "PORT",
		"value": "80"}],
...	
}
```

### create service
