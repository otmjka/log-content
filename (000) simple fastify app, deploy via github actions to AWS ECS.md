For me process of deployment myself tiny applications always was painful.

choosing platform, imagine how "everything" will work as a whole, where to start, what are exact steps.
 
 from point - you have working app in development environment 
 to point - your application placed in internet and can be opened by someone in his browser.

prerequirements:



the goals are:

1. set up a deploy the app to the aws ecs via pushing to `production` branch
2. easy to create resources for an app in aws ecr.

## set up a deploy the app to the aws ecs via pushing to `production` branch



[github doc: Deploying to Amazon Elastic Container Service](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/use-cases-and-examples/deploying/deploying-to-amazon-elastic-container-service)

it follows from [deploy workflow ./github/workflows/deploy.yaml](https://github.com/otmjka/aws-node-app/blob/main/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml)
that we need

```
${{ vars.AWS_REGION }} # AWS region, e.g. us-west-1
${{ vars.ECR_REPOSITORY }} # Amazon ECR repository name
${{ vars.ECS_SERVICE }} # Amazon ECS service name
${{ vars.ECS_CLUSTER }} # Amazon ECS cluster name

# set this to the name of the container in the
# containerDefinitions section of your task definition
${{ vars.CONTAINER_NAME }} 

# set this to the path to your Amazon ECS task definition
# file, e.g. .aws/task-definition.json
ECS_TASK_DEFINITION 


```

and the variables gonna populate in `easy to create resources for an app in aws ecr.` section via `terraform`.

and we populate `ECS_TASK_DEFINITION`  by `./aws-ecs-task-defenition.json`
and `./aws-ecs-task-defenition.json` from aws-created json task-defenition 

after all we should pul all variables at your repository action variables(settings -> variables and secrets -> actions)

moreover we will need aws user credentials
```
${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
```

this will be brifly descibe in follow step `signup in aws`
## easy to create resources for an app in aws ecr.

### signup in aws

go to aws and explore a stuff about `free tier`.
register on aws for `free tier`, there is required payment info.
after this step, we can create an user.

%here source where can check for aws registration, user creation%

after this we have

```
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
AWS_REGION: eu-north-1
```

### terraform 

[install terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli)

go to aws and explore a stuff about `free tier`.

register on aws for `free tier`, there is required payment info.

after this step, we can create an user.

%here source where can check for aws registration, user creation%

after this we have

```
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
AWS_REGION: eu-north-1
```

now we need to create 

repository for the project, this can be done by aws ui:
[AWS ECR](https://eu-north-1.console.aws.amazon.com/ecr/get-started?region=eu-north-1) `->` [repositories](https://eu-north-1.console.aws.amazon.com/ecr/private-registry/repositories?region=eu-north-1) `->` Create repository

```
ECR_REPOSITORY: akjmto/aws-node-app
```

### terraform 

[install terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli)

there are in [./terraform/](https://github.com/otmjka/aws-node-app/blob/main/terraform/) folder needed configs

```
├── terraform
│   ├── main.tf
│   ├── provider.tf
│   └── variables.tf
```

we need to initializate `terraform`

```bash
terraform init
```

```tfvars
aws_region = "eu-north-1"
aws_ecs_task_definitionArn = "arn:aws:ecs:eu-north-1:111111111111:task-definition/aws-node-app-task-family:2"
desired_count = 1
app_name = "aws-node-app"
cluster_name = "otmjka-microservices"
service_name = "aws-node-app-service"
container_image = "111111111111.dkr.ecr.{aws_region}.amazonaws.com/akjmto/aws-node-app"
container_port = 80
availability_zones = [ "eu-north-1a", "eu-north-1b" ]
vpc_name = "aws-node-app-vpc"
alb_name = "aws-node-app-load-balancer"
repo_name = "akjmto/aws-node-app"
task_def_family_name = "aws-node-app-task-def-family"
container_name = "aws-node-app"
tg_name = "aws-node-app-tg"
ecs_task_execution_role_name = "aws-node-app-ecs-task-execution-role"
```

to compile our files we should perform:
```bash
terraform plan
```

and if all ok perfom `apply`:

```bash
terraform apply
```

farmim for deploy.yaml

```yaml
AWS_REGION: vars.aws_region # terraform/variables.tf
ECR_REPOSITORY: vars.repo_name # terraform/variables.tf
ECS_CLUSTER: cluster_name # terraform/variables.tf
ECS_SERVICE: service_name # terraform/variables.tf

# file, e.g. .aws/task-definition.json

CONTAINER_NAME:

${{ vars.CONTAINER_NAME }} # set this to the name of the container in the

# containerDefinitions section of your task definition

```

ECS_TASK_DEFINITION:./aws-ecs-task-defenition.json # set this to the path to your Amazon ECS task definition


after go to 
```
1. [Amazon Elastic Container Service]
2. [Task definitions]
3. [vars.task_def_family_name]
4. [Revision 1]
5. Containers
6. JSON
7. copy to clipboard
8. paste ./aws-ecs-task-defenition.json
9. remove useless taskDefinitionArn, revision, compatibilities, registeredAt, registeredBy
```

Here is example

[./aws-ecs-task-defenition.json](https://github.com/otmjka/aws-node-app/blob/main/aws-ecs-task-defenition.json)
